Review: Loops
Great job! In this lesson, we learned how to write less repetitive code with loops.

for loops allow us to repeat a block of code a known amount of times.
We can use a for loop inside another for loop to compare two lists.
while loops are for looping over a code block an unknown amount of times.
Infinite loops occur when stop conditions are never met.
