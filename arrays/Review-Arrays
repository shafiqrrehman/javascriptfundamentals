Review Arrays
Nice work! In this lesson, we learned these concepts regarding arrays:

Arrays are lists and are a way to store data in JavaScript.
Arrays are created with brackets [].
Each item inside of an array is at a numbered position, starting at 0.
We can access one item in an array using its numbered position, with syntax like: myArray[0].
We can also change an item in an array using its numbered position, with syntax like myArray[0] = "new string";
Arrays have a length property, which allows you to see how many items are in an array.
Arrays have their own methods, including .push() and .pop(), which add and remove items from an array, respectively.
Arrays have many other methods that perform different functions, such as .slice() and .shift(). You can read the documentation for any array method on the Mozilla Developer Network website.
Variables that contain arrays can be declared with let or const. Even when declared with const, arrays are still mutable; they can be changed. However, a variable declared with const cannot be reassigned.
